I attempted to follow the Ship and Weapon Pack file organization, this should allow for an ease
of transfer (hopefully) if this ever gets put into the Ship and Weapon Pack main mod

Added the following ships, they were sprited by BreenBB.

Falcon		(Lion Guard variant)
Striker 	(XIV Battlegroup variant)
Vindicator 	(XIV Battlegroup variant)
Vindicator 	(XIV Battlegroup variant of (S) Vindicator)
Liberator	(XIV Battlegroup variant)
Liberator	(XIV Battlegroup variant of Luddic Church variant. AKA: Dumbfire mining missiles instead of a hangar bay)

IMPORTANT STUFF THAT I DID OR DIDN'T CHANGE:

I kept the dumbfire mining missiles on the Liberator LC XIV variant as they are built in and I didn't want to mess up anything
I figure this will be tweaked anyways if it ever gets added to the base mod

I didn't add the "hist1" or "hist2t" to any of these ships in their .skin file. Please tweak if needed

I used a basic baseValueMult of 1.25, since I see that value a lot. Please tweak if needed.

I added 10 ordnancePoints to each xiv skin. From my understanding and observation, each XIV variant gets 10 additional ordinance points
